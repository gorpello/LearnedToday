If you're feeling bored, like I am right now, and you want to pass the time in true nerd style, I might have something for you.

There is a way to "watch" the entire Star Wars: Episode IV movie in ASCII animations.
Using telnet, you can run the following command in the terminal to start the animation:

```bash
telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl
```

If `telnet` is not installed on macOS, you can get it with `brew`:

```bash
brew install telnet
```

Itâ€™s absolutely useless, but really impressive ðŸ¤©.
